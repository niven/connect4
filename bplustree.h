/*********************** Node cache types ************************/

/*
Node cache.

Having a cache makes sure we hit the disk as little as possible.

Constraints:
- The items in the cache must be refcounted (since an item could be retrieved more than once, and is used)
- Nothing with a refcount > 0 can ever be freed
- Keep as many nodes as possible in the cache (ie, keep it full at all times)
- retrieve must be O(1)
- release must be O(1)

Overview:
In order to have O(1) access the nodes are stored in a hash. Every bucket uses separate chaining.
Adding an item to the cache can happen when it is not full yet or when there is at least 1 "free entry".
A free entry means a node that has refcount == 0. The retrieve works by removing the free entry from the cache
and then inserting normally. This is in fact the normal situation: the cache is completely full but has some
free entries that can be recycled.

Finding a free entry must then also be O(1), which is why there is a separate free list (just a doubly linked list of free_entry's).

The cache entry holds a pointer to either a node or a free_entry.

Operations:
(1) Insert, space in the cache:
	- hash the key
	- create an entry
	- set the node ptr of the entry
(2) Insert, no space in the cache, free entry present
	- take the first free entry
	- hash the key
	- find the entry in the bucket
	- remove the entry from the bucket
	- free the entry
	- free the node pointed to by the free entry
	- free the free_entry
	- decrement num_stored
	- go to (1)
(3) Insert, no space in cache, no free entry:
	- don't insert
(4) Release, item not in the cache
	- free the item
(5) Release, item in the cache with refcount > 1
	- hash the key
	- find the entry in the bucket
	- decrement its refcount
(6) Release, item in the cache with refcount == 1
	- hash the key etc.
	- set its refcount to 0
	- create a new free_entry
	- set the free_entry to point to the node the entry points to
	- set the entry ptr to point to the free_entry
	- insert the free_enty in the free_list
(7) Retrieve, item in the cache, refcount > 0
	- increment its refcount
(8) Retrieve, item in the cache, refcount == 0
	- find the entry
	- find the free_entry it points to
	- set the entry to point to the node pointed to by the free_entry
	- set its refcount to 1
	- free the free_entry
(9) Retrieve, item not in the cache
	- load it from disk
	- Insert

Committing nodes to disk:
When a node is created or retrieved from disk we put it in the cache, when it has to be evicted we write it to disk.
Whenever the cache is full and nothing can be evicted, on release it has to written to disk regardless.

TODO(performance): keep the free items as dirty/clean and recycle the clean ones to avoid writes, and probably also in Most Frequently Used order maybe,
							or maybe even use the is_dirty flag as a counter (mabe things that are very dirty are hot? Dunno)
TODO(profiling): distribution of hits/misses/dirty per node
